### Introduction

### Design Statement
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 

### Competitor analysis:
#### Heuristic Evalution
This is a heuristic analysis of journal/self care tracking apps through the lens of middle aged women. This will be done by assessing two mobile apps, Jour and Tangerine and comment on what has been done well and what aspects can be improved upon. My overall project that builds off this analysis will be the creation of a simple, easy to use journaling/tracking app that improves mental health and productivity for middle aged women.

#### Usability Testing
The Tangerine mobile application is used as a self-care journaling app that helps users keep track of their moods, habits, and thoughts. While the app is mostly simple and straightforward, there were a few usability issues discovered from the heuristic analysis previously done. First, the app seems to be geared towards a younger generation as well as a less formal setting due to some of the vocabulary and emoji icons used. This leads to a mismatch between the app system and real world concepts. Second, there is a lack of direction on the app that could hinder users' effectiveness of self-journaling. This is an issue of visibility of system status. Third, there is extraneous and unclear information regarding some of the important statistics (ie: the graphs or previous moods journaled). This is an issue of aesthetic and minimalist design where not all important information is easily accessible and unimportant information hidden. Thus, I will be conducting this usability test in order to gain user feedback on these 3 potential user issues by completing 3 tasks related to these topics. The goal of this process is to improve the user experience of this app as well as information on how to best optimize self-care journaling apps.

### User research: contextual inquiry
This project aims to support users in their psychological needs. More specifically, this project hopes to give users a reliable way to practice proper journaling and habit tracking in order to maintain health habits in terms of mental and physical activity. As a result of user research, I learned a lot about my own reasoning for creating this project as well as the user's more broad and holistic thoughts on the project as a whole. Some insights that I gleaned from the participant were the overall lack of knowledge about journaling and its potential mental and physical health benefits, the kinds of habits that general user's would like to track, and the potential gains that users predict from beginning journaling.

### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
My project revolves around the effects of journaling on mental health of users. However, to understand what kind of effects journaling can and should have on users' mental health, it is necesary to understand the user itself. Therefore, the purpose of UX storytelling in my project in particular is to get within the mind of the user and understand how they may think and feel about certain aspects of journaling and the resulting effects. It also gives an idea for me to understand how to make journaling easiest and most effective for the targeting users. Below, I have shown an example of a persona, empathy map, and journey map for the task of creating a daily journal.

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment06 + part of 07]
### Low-fidelity prototype 
The purpose of this low fidelity prototype is to test how specific users will interact with the features and flow of the app as expected. The most important part is to gain feedback on whether or not the flow of each task is intuitive and clear and thus gain feedback on which improvements should be made. In addition, this prototype will draw on my user research which revealed the lack of knowledge on daily journals and the potential benefits of it. My user research also helped clarify what exactly users want to record and prioritize when it comes to creating daily journals.
Here is a low fidelity prototype of creating a daily journal.

### High-fidelity prototype
The main purpose of this design was simplicity and creating a certain mood that would create the intended effect on the user. Since journaling should be a calming and positive activity done normally at night, shades of blue and purple were used. It should be noted that any and all unnecessary features are removed in order to create a simplified process as well as replicate the inspiration of a manual journal. Thus, the two focuses for the design were keeping only necessary features and having a pleasant color that would keep the user comfortable.
### Optional evaluation and revision history 
Including cognitive walkthrough; impression test, accessibility audit, usability testing), per each summary and link to the notes (when you share the video or other detailed evidences, I will notify you when you can make the contents private as soon as your work is graded)
